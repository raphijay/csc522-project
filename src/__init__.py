# __init__.py file is an empty file that is used to mark a directory as a Python package. When Python
# imports a package, it looks for the __init__.py file in the directory and executes it.
# It can contain initialization code that should be executed when the package is imported. For example,
# you can define variables, functions, classes, or import modules in the __init__.py file.
